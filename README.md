# 3. NAKA

We were a team of four developers; the MVP was made in 24h at the Oxford Hack 2017 (november). Javascript -Jquery, PHP. My role: front-end (html css jquery). <br>
NAKA is a medical desktop application: it records what the patient says ( speech-to-text Microsoft Cognitive Services API), automatically highlights the symptoms recognised, and propose the six latest piece of research given the diagnostics suggested by the doctor. <br>
The patient would accumulate a database of symptoms highlighted over time with its past diagnostics, which would therefore be accessible by the other doctors when she/he would consult elsewhere. <br><br>
